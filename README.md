Audit compliance on information/data flow graphs has been extensively studied and there exist numerous applications which allow for provenance capture and also check for data flow violations on these provenance graphs. However, the subgraph which actually contains the violation is usually very small compared to the entire information flow graph generated by the system. Thus, lots of disk space can be saved by developing a framework which could verify compliance and enforce application-specific information security guarantees from the data provenance graphs generated by the application, directly at runtime. The goal of the project is to achieve an in-memory solution to this by designing single-pass graph algorithms to detect violations from the massive streaming provenance graphs.

This repository contains the source code for the same.
